# Dark-Light-mode-Switcher

This project is a simple example of a switcher that allows toggling between light and dark modes on a web page. The project code can be found on the following CodePen link: [Switcher Light Dark Mode on CodePen](https://codepen.io/AndrewLenz21/pen/MWzQEpQ).

## Description

The Light Dark Mode switcher is a commonly implemented feature in applications and websites, enabling users to customize their viewing experience based on their preferences. In this project, a basic switcher has been implemented that changes the background and text colors of a page to toggle between light and dark modes.

## Features

- **Mode Toggle Button**: The project includes a button in the interface that allows the user to switch between light and dark modes.
- **Style Alternation**: Clicking the button triggers a JavaScript function that changes the CSS styles of the page, adjusting the background and text colors based on the selected mode.
- **Configuration Persistence**: If the user closes or refreshes the page, the selected mode configuration is maintained using cookies or local storage (depending on the specific implementation).

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- **HTML**: Used to structure the content of the page and provide necessary elements.
- **CSS**: Used to define the visual styles of the page and switch them based on the selected mode.
- **JavaScript**: Used to handle the switcher logic and toggle between light and dark modes.
- **Cookies or Local Storage**: Used to store the selected mode configuration and maintain persistence across the page.

## How to Use the Project

1. Access the project link on CodePen provided above.
2. Observe the interface displaying the content and the mode toggle button.
3. Click the button to toggle between light and dark modes.
4. Notice how the background and text colors of the page change based on the selected mode.
